# Progress

## What Works
-   **Initial Setup & `POST /notifications` Endpoint Implementation (Verified).**
-   **Email Sending Functionality via AWS SES (Implemented - Needs Full User Testing).**
-   **Multi-SMS Provider Backend Structure (Twilio, AWS SNS, Textbee - Implemented - Needs Full User Testing):**
    -   System refactored for selectable SMS providers.
    -   AWS SNS and Twilio provider logic in place.
    -   `Textbee` provider (`app/providers/sms_textbee_provider.py`) implemented based on user-provided API documentation.
-   **Frontend UI Integration (Enhanced - Needs Full User Testing).**
-   **Android Push Notification via AWS SNS (FCM Integration - Backend Implemented - Needs Full User Testing).**

## What's Left to Build
-   **User External Setup & Configuration (Crucial for Testing All Channels):**
    *   AWS SES: Verify sender email, manage sandbox.
    *   Firebase & AWS SNS for Push: Set up FCM project, SNS Platform Application.
    *   Update `.env` with all credentials: AWS (SES, SNS SMS, SNS Push), Twilio, Textbee (API key, Device ID).
-   **Database Recreation (User Task):**
    *   User to delete `db_data/notifications.db` (due to multiple schema changes and provider enum change).
-   **Rebuild and Restart Services (User Task):**
    *   User to run `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up --build -d`.
-   **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing (User Task):**
    *   Test device registration for push notifications.
    *   Test sending Email (SES), SMS (Twilio, AWS SNS, Textbee), and Push (SNS Android) notifications via UI/API.
    *   Verify worker processing, delivery, and logs for all channels.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    *   In-App notification logic.
    *   Error handling/retries for all providers.
    *   Secure credential management for production.
    *   Pydantic V2 warning.
    *   Scheduler, comprehensive tests, monitoring, etc.

## Current Status
-   **Phase:** `Textbee` Provider Implementation Complete. All core requested channels (Email, multi-provider SMS, Android Push) have backend implementations.
-   **Activity:** The `Textbee` provider module has been fully implemented by replacing `httpSMS`. The system is now, from a backend code perspective, feature-complete for the requested notification channels. The next critical phase is comprehensive end-to-end testing by the user, which requires significant external service configuration and local setup.
-   **Reminder:** Database schema changed (SmsProviderEnum). `notifications.db` **must** be deleted. Docker image needs rebuild. External service configurations are pending from the user for full testing.

## Known Issues
-   Worker is run manually.
-   Pydantic V2 warning persists.
-   IN_APP channel is a stub.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   Pivoted to multi-SMS provider architecture.
-   Integrated and iteratively refined `frontend.html`.
-   Migrated email sending from MailHog to AWS SES.
-   Added Android Push Notification capability using AWS SNS (with FCM).
-   Replaced `httpSMS` provider with `Textbee` provider based on user request and API documentation.
